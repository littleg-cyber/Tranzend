# Trazend

A peer to peer money app offering a simple and stress-free way to send and request money to and from your peers

## Description

This project served as my final project for the Nashville Software School's Front-End Web Development and Design Certificate. This project was developed over 5 months, with 4 months focusing on the design, followed by 3 weeks dedicated to coding. The primary goal of this third capstone project was to demonstrate the skills I have learned to bring my UI/UX designs to life. The application utilizes local data, React/NextJS, and the MUI component library.

## Technologies Used

- **React/NextJS**: Implemented for the frontend development.
- **MUI Component Library**: Utilized to enhance the app's design and functionality.
- **Local Data**: Integrated to support the application's data requirements.
- **Figma**: Used for designing and prototyping.
- **Miro**: Used during the discovery and designing portion of the project.

## Features

- Send/Request money to your peer
- Look at the payment History page
- Schedule a payment request or payment to a peer
